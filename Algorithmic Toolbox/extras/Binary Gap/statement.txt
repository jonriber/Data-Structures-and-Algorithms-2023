Description of the problem

input ==> number

return ==> length of binary gap

PSEUDO CODE:
1 - TRANSFORM DECIMAL INPUT TO BINARY AND STORE IT INSIDE SOME VARIABLE
2 - TREAT THE BINARY VARIABLE TO REMOVE ANY UNNECESSARY characteristc, in python we can do this: [2:], in Js, maybe a split?
3 - Create two variables, max_counter, zero_counter, both equal to zero_counter
4 - ONE iteration through each element in binary representation
5 - if zero = increment the zero_counter
6 - if One - compare current zero counter with max_counter, update if necessary then clear zero_counter
7 - return max_counter

TESTS:
1 - check input is valid
2 - validade input is in range
3 - boudary tests:
     - negative numbers shouldn't be accepted and should return zero
     - Zero number should return 0, there is no gaps, only zeros


MY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM:
1 - The program will always do a full iteration over the array
2 - So, By the end of this iteration, what really matters is the max_value, set by the number 1
